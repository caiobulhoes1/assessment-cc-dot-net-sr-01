.NET Coding Challenge - Battle of Monsters V4.0.0 for Full Stack Labs.

The Coding Challenge has been designed to test my coding skills and problem-solving abilities. This challenge was a great way to push myself and learn new things.

Stacks: .NET 8.0, EntityFramework, xUnit, Moq, Sqlite inMemory.

I built an API and all the Tests from the scratch.
